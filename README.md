# End of Class Reflection

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem I was solving in the projects was to form a data algorithm out of data structures given to us during the course.
The first project requires you to solve the runtime and memory of data structures (vector, hash tables, tree), and the second project
reqiures you to formulate a working structure listed in alphanumerical order using the runtime that works the best for you.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I apporached the problem by deducing what worked for me during my completion of the assignments listed in the class. With each data
structure there is a fundamentaly different way each works, and not understanding how each work can lead to coders not realizing how 
each structure is required based on the course objects that needs to be created in the file. Understanding this, I needed to see what
kind of data structure will work better based on the information printed (ex: printing courses in alphanumerical order), and realise
something simple like the vector structure is more suitable for the task I was given.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I simply overcame my roadblocks by giving myself downtime to grasp the fundaments needed for the project. Whenever I become fustrated
with what is needed to print inside the project, I give myself time to think by drinking water, or going outside to breath. After a while 
of reflection, and going over notes made during the development, I go back to the code with a new apporach on the structure. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

It made me realize that different structues are needed based on the information given to the system to output. Before this I never understood
why some data did not work properly with certain content, but now that I went through this course I now gained a better grasp on the fundaments of 
data algorithms. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This work helped me understand the importance in making an readable code that does not harbor on random guesswork that is only done to make the
program work. All the coding done inside the structure must make sense to the coder, and to the user of said code without alienating them on what
works specific structures in the file. I grew confident with my coding skills thanks to this class cementing the importance in making a reusable code
that can be transferable for future projects and production in professional fields.
